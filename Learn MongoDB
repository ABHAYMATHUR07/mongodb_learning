What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It's known for its scalability, flexibility, and performance in handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Key Concepts:

Documents: In MongoDB, data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents. Each document can have its own unique structure, which means you don't need to predefine a schema like you would in a traditional relational database.

Example:
{
  _id: ObjectId("60ed2edc18fceb7e3c7f9b0a"),
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY",
    country: "USA"
  },
  hobbies: ["reading", "traveling", "photography"]
}
Here, _id is a unique identifier for the document, similar to a primary key in relational databases.

Collections: A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It's the equivalent of a table in relational databases.

Example:

Collection: users
Queries: MongoDB uses a powerful query language to retrieve documents based on specific criteria. Queries can target fields in nested documents and arrays.

Example:

Find all users who live in New York:
db.users.find({ "address.city": "New York" })
Indexes: MongoDB supports indexes to improve query performance. Indexes are data structures that store a small portion of the collectionâ€™s data set in an easy-to-traverse form.

Example:

Creating an index on the email field:
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 })
Aggregation: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework for performing data processing tasks such as grouping, filtering, and transforming data.

Example:
Calculate the average age of users:
javascript
Copy code
db.users.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: null, avgAge: { $avg: "$age" } } }
])

Real-World Example:
Imagine you're building an e-commerce platform. Here's how MongoDB might be used:
Users Collection:

{
  _id: ObjectId("60ed2edc18fceb7e3c7f9b0a"),
  username: "johndoe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  passwordHash: "hashedPassword...",
  addresses: [
    { type: "shipping", street: "123 Main St", city: "New York", state: "NY" },
    { type: "billing", street: "456 Elm St", city: "Los Angeles", state: "CA" }
  ]
}
Products Collection:

{
  _id: ObjectId("60ed2f8f18fceb7e3c7f9b0b"),
  name: "Smartphone",
  price: 799,
  description: "High-performance smartphone with advanced features.",
  category: "Electronics"
}
Orders Collection:

{
  _id: ObjectId("60ed2fc818fceb7e3c7f9b0c"),
  user_id: ObjectId("60ed2edc18fceb7e3c7f9b0a"),
  products: [
    { product_id: ObjectId("60ed2f8f18fceb7e3c7f9b0b"), quantity: 2 }
  ],
  totalAmount: 1598,
  status: "Pending",
  created_at: ISODate("2024-07-12T12:00:00Z")
}
In this example:

Users can have multiple addresses stored as nested documents in an array.
Products are stored with basic details and categorized.
Orders reference users and products with additional details like quantity and order status.
MongoDB's flexible schema and powerful querying make it ideal for scenarios where data structures evolve or where you need to store and query complex, hierarchical data efficiently.
