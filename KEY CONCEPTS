KEY POINTS ABOUT MongoDB 

NoSQL Database: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).

Documents: Data is stored in documents, which are JSON-like structures. Each document can have its own unique schema.

Collections: Documents are organized into collections, similar to tables in relational databases.

Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to handle larger data volumes and more users.

Indexes: Indexes can be created to improve query performance on fields frequently queried.

Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework for performing data processing tasks.

Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding, which divides data across multiple servers to distribute workload and improve performance.

Flexibility: Schema flexibility allows for easy updates and changes to data structures without downtime.

Geospatial Queries: MongoDB supports geospatial queries, making it suitable for location-based applications.

Replication: Provides high availability through replica sets, ensuring data redundancy and failover capabilities.

Atomic Operations: Supports atomic operations on single documents, ensuring data consistency.

GridFS: MongoDB includes GridFS for storing and retrieving large files, exceeding the BSON document size limit.
